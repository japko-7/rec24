## 1. React Letter Tiles
We provided a small React application with some starter code. Your goal is to modify the application so that it displays a tile for every letter in the alphabet in uppercase format. Then if a tile is clicked, that letter is appended to the current string that exists in the element with ID outputString.

If at any point there are 3 consecutive letters that are the same, replace them with an underscore. For example, if A, B, C, F, F, F, G is clicked in that order, the string that appears in outputString would be ABC_G. If 6 of the same letter appears after, for example, clicking A six times followed by a B, then outputString would be __B.

You are free to add classes and styles, but make sure you leave the component ID's and clases provided as they are. Submit your code once it is complete and our system will validate your output.

## 2. React Phone Book
We provided some simple React template code. Your goal is to create a simple form at the top that allows the user to enter in a first name, last name, and phone number and there should be a submit button. Once the submit button is pressed, the information should be displayed in a list below (automatically sorted by last name) along with all the previous information that was entered. This way the application can function as a simple phone book. When your application loads, the input fields (not the phone book list) should be prepopulated with the following values already:

`First name = Coder`
`Last name = Byte`
`Phone = 8885559999`

You are free to add classes and styles, but make sure you leave the component ID's and clases provided as they are. Submit your code once it is complete and our system will validate your output.

## 3. Letter Count
Have the function LetterCount(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the first word with the greatest number of repeated letters. For example: "Today, is the greatest day ever!" should return greatest because it has 2 e's (and 2 t's) and it comes before ever which also has 2 e's. If there are no words with repeating letters return -1. Words will be separated by spaces.

## 4. HTML CSS Grid Layout
We provided some simple HTML code. Your goal is to use CSS to create a grid layout. The layout should consist of a container with four equally sized grid items. Each grid item should have a border, padding, and a background color. The grid should have two columns and two rows, with a gap of `10px` between the grid items.

You are free to add classes and styles, but make sure you leave the IDs and classes provided as they are. Submit your code once it is complete, and our system will validate your output.
